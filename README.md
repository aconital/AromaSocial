## Front End Documentation

The front end of the website is generated by using Jade views rendered by Node.js - this is primarily in the app.js file.  
The jade files are fairly straightforward - the guest.jade view is for the navbar and footer when the user is not logged in.  The layout.jade file is for the navbar and footer when the user IS logged in.  Each view (besides layout.jade and guest.jade correspond to an individual webpage).

The styling of many of the elements are done using the Bootstrap framework.  Some elements like the Modal in the profile.js file are built using React-Bootstrap (a library for bootstrap components using react).  These elements are defined at the top of profile.js (for example: `var Modal = ReactBootstrap.Modal;`)

The front end uses React.js (http://facebook.github.io/react/) to render most of the components.  The components for the newsfeed page are rendered in newsfeed.js (in the public/javascripts/ folder), components for the profile page are rendered in profile.js and the search page components are rendered in the search.js file (all in the public/javascripts/ folder).

Each page has a div element

  * `scss/_settings.scss`:
