    <h1>Syncholar</h1>
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Update: May 24, 2016</strong></p>
    <p>This Statement is an addition to Syncholar&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://syncholar.com/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>.&nbsp;Therefore, the general definitions and provisions of the Terms and Conditions apply.</p>
    <p>We&nbsp;respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship we have with you. This Privacy Notice applies to personal information we collect on the Site.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Notice describes the types of personal information we collect on the Site, how we may use the information, with whom we may share it and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information. We also describe the measures we take to safeguard the information and tell you how to contact us about our privacy practices. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.&nbsp;You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.</p>
    <p>As used in this policy, the terms &ldquo;using&rdquo; and &ldquo;processing&rdquo; information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>
    <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
    <p>We may collect and use personal information&nbsp; to provide and improve our Site, Services, features, Content, and Collective Content, to administer your membership and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>
    <p>When you register with us through the Site to become a Syncholar Member or when you choose to create your own profile webpage we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (&ldquo;<strong>Personal Information</strong>&rdquo;). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, telephone number, home and business postal addresses, age, research interests, gender, education and occupation. We use your Personal Information to provide the Syncholar Service and administer your inquiries.</p>
    <p>Syncholar also collects other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (&ldquo;<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>&rdquo;).</p>
    <p>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Syncholar Service, complete your transactions and administer your inquiries.</p>
    <p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,&nbsp;combining your zip code with your street address)&nbsp;in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,&nbsp;your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Syncholar Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>
    <p>We may use your Personal Information to contact you with Syncholar updates, newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, you can unsubscribe or send an email to support@syncholar.com.</p>
    <p>We may obtain certain personal information from third party companies or websites (such as, but not limited to, Linkedin and orcid) through their OAuth system when you choose to provide them through our Site. You will be notified through the third party Oauth page about the types of personal information we may collect.</p>
    <p>In addition, when you visit our Site, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies.</p>
    <p>The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our site, and dates and times of website visits.</p>
    <p>A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. On this Site, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you close your browser, they are deleted. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last beyond each visit to the Site and remain on your hard drive after you close your browser. The cookies used on the Site include those that are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies) and remember your choices (functionality cookies).</p>
    <p>We may use the information we obtain from your use of our cookies for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>to recognize your computer when you visit the Site</li>
        <li>to track you as you navigate the Site</li>
        <li>to improve the Site&rsquo;s usability</li>
        <li>to analyze use of the Site</li>
        <li>to manage the Site</li>
        <li>to personalize the Site</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Site.</p>
    <p>When you visit the Site, whether as a Syncholar Member or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (&ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;). This Log Data may include information such as your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site&rsquo;s technical administration, to increase our Site&rsquo;s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors&rsquo; needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we may use the information we obtain through the Site to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create and manage your account;</li>
        <li>Offer and provide products, services and information to you, including newsletters;</li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as Google Analytics. These service providers help us analyze how users use our Site. The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. These service providers may retain and use anonymised, aggregated data collected from users of our Site in connection with their own businesses, including in order to improve their products and services. You can learn more about opting out of data collection through Google Analytics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This Site is not designed to respond to &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals received from browsers.</p>
    <p>As part of the Service, Syncholar Members can invite non-registered friends to join the Site by sending invitation emails through use of their Accounts via our automated invitation system. Syncholar stores the email addresses that Members provide only for the purposes of sending the invitations, adding respondents to the colleagues list of the Member who sent the invitation, and sending reminders of the invitations (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from Members may contact Syncholar at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@syncholar.com">support@syncholar.com</a>&nbsp;to request the removal of their email address from our database.</p>
    <p><strong>Information We Share</strong></p>
    <p>Our Site may feature blogs, forums and discussion groups. Please be aware that some or all of the information you provide (including personal information) in connection with these activities may be made publicly available.</p>
    <p>We share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, when you make a purchase we may share information about you and your transaction with other companies for the purpose of processing your transaction. In addition, we may retain third party service providers to manage our customer databases or distribute e-mail offerings.</p>
    <p>We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).</p>
    <p>The personal information that you provide to us may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile,&nbsp;<strong>you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of our User Agreement and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy.</strong>&nbsp;Supplying to us any information deemed &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Protection of The Information That We Collect</strong></p>
    <p>We are very concerned with safeguarding your information. We use reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures to protect Member information and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <p>We maintain a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information that we collect from unauthorized access. We use industry accepted procedures and systems to protect against unauthorized access to our systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; We restrict access to your Personal Information to those Syncholar employees, agents and contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, or to provide Services to you or otherwise assist you, and that are legally bound to maintain the confidentiality of your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. We maintain your Personal Information so that it is as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. We encourage you to help us keep our information current. We retain Personal Information for as long as is necessary to fulfill any of Our business purposes and Services, or to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and regulatory requests and orders from competent courts and regulatory bodies.</p>
    <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
    <p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to &mdash; and maintained on &mdash; computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Your information collected through the Site may be stored and processed in Canada, the United States or any other country in which Syncholar maintains facilities.</p>
    <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
    <p><strong>Our Policy Toward Children</strong></p>
    <p>This Site is not directed to persons under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children or minors under the age of 18. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:support@syncholar.com">support@syncholar.com</a>. If we become aware that a person under the age of 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>
    <p><strong>MODIFICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
    <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on this web page, and if the changes are significant, we will post a more prominent notice on this page or we will directly send you a notification. You may determine when this Privacy Policy was last changed by referring to the modification date found at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. You agree that your continued use of the Services after notice of such change shall constitute your acceptance of the Privacy Policy. You agree to review this Privacy Policy regularly in order to inform yourself of the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and any modifications to the Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong><br /> <strong>Phishing</strong></strong></p>
    <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as &ldquo;phishing&rdquo; are of great concern to Us. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.</p>
    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
    <p>As part of Syncholar&rsquo;s functionality, We link to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by &ldquo;clicking on&rdquo; a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party&rsquo;s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Claims regarding copyright infringement</strong></p>
    <p>Syncholar respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that violates those rights. Our User Agreement requires that information posted by Members be accurate, lawful and not in violation of the rights of third parties. To promote these objectives, Syncholar provides a process for submission of complaints concerning content posted by our Members. Our policy and procedures are described and/or referenced in the sections that follow.</p>
    <p>Please note that whether or not we disable access to or remove content, Syncholar may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant&rsquo;s contact information, to the Member who posted the content and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the Member that Syncholar has received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.</p>
    <p>Please note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice.</p>
